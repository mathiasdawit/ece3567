This repository contains the files for a program that runs on the MSP430FR6989 microcontroller by Texas Instruments. The program uses embedded C and TI’s assembly language to optimize a feedback control system the microcontroller. Final product was a device which receives commands from a laptop, which control the device’s behavior. Displays temperature to a liquid-crystal display and a peripherial LED with colors corresponding to the temperature. Commands determine whether display is in Fahrenheit or Celsius, among other control options.
